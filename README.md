## 🛠️ Built-in Binaries

This application is fully self-contained. It bundles:
- **ADB** (Android Debug Bridge)
- **Scrcpy** executable
- **Scrcpy-server**

At startup, these are extracted to a temporary directory and used automatically. You don't need to configure your system PATH.

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Xiaomi/Poco/Redmi Users

To enable **touch control** in Scrcpy, you must:
1. Go to **Developer Options**.
2. Enable **USB Debugging**.
3. Enable **USB Debugging (Security settings)**. 
   *(Note: This requires a SIM card and Mi Account login on most Xiaomi devices).*
